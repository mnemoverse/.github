## 🌟 About Us

Mnemoverse builds the **cognitive layer for AI agents** - a universal memory and understanding system that enables agents to work with any type of information (code, documentation, research) as fluidly as experienced developers navigate their mental models.

## 🚀 Our Mission

To create the infrastructure for persistent, collaborative agent intelligence through specialized memory systems and universal tool coordination.

## 🛠️ What We're Building

- **🤖 MCP Documentation Server** - Published on npm, direct access to complete documentation in any MCP-compatible IDE
- **📚 Research Infrastructure** - 300+ curated AI research sources with semantic search and AI librarian "Ala"  
- **🧠 Agent Memory Systems** - Persistent knowledge bases with LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration
- **🔗 Universal Tool Access** - MCP coordination protocols eliminating the 128-tool limit in AI assistants

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ **Production Ready & Open Source**
- **[@mnemoverse/mcp-docs-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mnemoverse/mcp-docs-server)** - MCP server for AI assistants
- **[Research Library](https://github.com/mnemoverse/mnemoverse-research-library)** - AI research database with 300+ sources
- **[Documentation](https://github.com/mnemoverse/mnemoverse-docs)** - Comprehensive guides and technical specifications
### 🚧 **In Development**
- **[Mnemoverse Arch](https://github.com/mnemoverse/mnemoverse-arch)** - Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph + Mem0
- **[Chat UI](https://github.com/mnemoverse/mnemoverse-chat-ui)** - Next.js interface with tool integration
- **[Universal MCP Index](https://github.com/mnemoverse/mnemoverse)** - Tool coordination at scale

## 🎯 Measurable Goals (3-Year Vision)

By 2028, we will be the cognitive layer for AI agents:
- **100,000+ agents** using our system daily
- **<1s response time** for 95% of queries  
- **90% reduction** in context-related errors
- **Supporting projects** with 10M+ lines of code
